# Month Calendar

I'm excited to share my month calendar created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! While it may not have all the bells and whistles of a fully-featured calendar, I think you'll find it to be a useful tool for planning and scheduling. The calendar offers a clear and concise view of the current month. While it doesn't have interactive features such as adding events or appointments, you can still use it to plan out your schedule and stay on top of important dates. With some further development, I hope to expand its functionality in the future. Overall, I'm proud of what I've created and I hope you find it helpful as well.

## New Things I Learned

Making the month calendar was a great learning experience for me. One of the most interesting things I discovered was the **`toDateString()`** method, which made it easy to convert dates into a more readable format.

Using **`getDay()`** and for loops were also new concepts that I incorporated into my project. It was great to see how they could be used to create a more efficient and streamlined calendar. I'm excited to continue building on these skills and see how they can be applied in other projects.

## Challenges I faced

Getting the first and last day of each month dynamically was definitely one of the biggest challenges I faced when creating the calendar. I had to do a lot of research and experimentation to figure out how to do it effectively. Additionally, the CSS portion of the project required a lot of trial and error to get everything lined up perfectly.

As for changing the highlight for the current day using loops, that was definitely something that took me some time to grasp. But with some practice and persistence, I was ultimately able to make it work.

All in all, I definitely learned a lot while working on this project, and I'm looking forward to applying what I learned to future projects.
